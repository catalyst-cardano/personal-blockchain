## 4. Key Trends & Insights  
- **Insight 1:**  
  The faucet feature is seen as overly complex and unnecessary when it could be directly integrated into the account creation process. This would simplify the user experience.  
- **Insight 2:**  
  Performance issues in blockchain syncing and character limits in the on-chain message field are major areas for improvement to enhance user experience.  
- **Insight 3:**  
  Error messages need to be more clear and detailed to help users understand and resolve issues more effectively.  

## 5. Recommendations  
- Integrate the faucet feature into the account creation process and automatically preload a large amount of ADA into newly created accounts.  
- Remove the character limit in the “add on-chain message” field on the “Send Token” screen.  
- Prioritize improving blockchain syncing performance.  
- Adjust the default network configuration to be more user-friendly for new users.  
- Improve error messages to provide clear and actionable information.
